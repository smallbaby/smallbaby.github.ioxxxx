        <h2 id="Eugenie-Clark-Shark-Lady"><a href="#Eugenie-Clark-Shark-Lady" class="headerlink" title="Eugenie Clark, Shark Lady"></a>Eugenie Clark, Shark Lady</h2><p>Eugenie Clark is a famous scientist, She has spent her life studying fish. Sharks are some of<br>her favorite fish. Eugenie has traveled around the world to learn about different kinds of sharks. Many<br>people call Eugenie Clark the “shark lady.”</p>
<p>When Eugenie was a young girl, she spent hours observing fish at the New York Aquarium. Eugenie learned about<br>different kinds of fish, and she pretended she was in the water with them. She wondered what it would feel like<br>to be one of the fish.</p>
<p>At home, Eugenie set up her own fish tank. She watched her fish carefully and took notes about what they did. She<br>Wrote about fish and read about them. It was her dream to become a scientist someday.</p>
<p>Not many women were scientists when Eugenie was young.But that didn’t stop her. When Eugenie went to college, she<br>took science classes and became a fish expert.</p>
<p>Eugenie decided to dive deep in the sea, so she could study fish where they live.She learned how to dive with a mask<br>and how to use underwater breathing equipment.</p>
<p>The first time Eugenie saw a shark under the water, she was surprised. The huge shark swam right past her. Eugenie<br>thought it was beautiful, and she was sorry when it swam away.</p>
<p>Eugenie traveled to different parts of the world to study fish. She wrote about her work and became a Well-Known scientist.<br>Then she was asked to start a lab in Florida. The lab was a place where Eugenie and other scientists could study fish.</p>
<p>In the lab, Eugenie tested lemon sharks to see how smart they were. Eugenie trained the sharks to do things. The sharks learned<br>to ring a bell to get food.</p>
<p>Eugenie Clark says that she is not afraid of sharks. She is too interested in them to be scared. But she also says it is important<br>to understand how sharks act.</p>
<p>Eugenie used an underwater cage to study great white sharks. These sharks can be dangerous to people, but Eugenie studied them from<br>inside the cage where she was safe. She observed the sharks and took pictures of them.</p>
<p>Eugenie even went for a ride on a whale shark, the biggest fish in the sea. She grabbed the shark as it swam by her. Then she tried to<br>sit on the shark’s back, but she couldn’t stay on.</p>
<p>Eugenie slid down and held on to the shark’s tail for as long as she could. The shark swam faster and faster. But Eugenie did not feel<br>scared.</p>
<p>Finally, Eugenie had to let go. As she watched the huge shark swim away, she felt happy. Eugenie had learned what it felt like to be a shark!</p>
<p>Eugenie Clark has spent her life studying sharks and other fish. she loves to share what she was learned about them. She talks to scientists<br> and students who visit her lab. She writes books, and she writes articles for magazines, too. Eugenie hopes that other people will love<br>learning about the sea.</p>
